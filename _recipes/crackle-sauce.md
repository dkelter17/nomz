Don't forget to double it!

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of roasted peanuts
- 3 Tbsp sesame seeds
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/2 inch piece of ginger
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1.5 tsp red pepper flakes
- 3 Tbsp coconut milk (use the rest of the can to make [coconut rice]({% link _recipes/coconut-rice.md %})!)

## Instructions

1. Chop or crush 1/2 cup of roasted peanuts.
2. Combine chopped peanuts, 3 Tbsp sesame seeds, and 1/4 cup olive oil in a
   large non-stick skillet.
3. Cook on medium heat, stirring *often*, until
   peanuts are several shades darker and the sesame seeds are toasted (~6-8
   min).
4. Remove mixture from the heat and transfer to a (small) bowl. While the
   oil is still hot, finely grate 2 garlic cloves and 1/2 inch piece of
   ginger right into the mixture.
5. Next, stir in 1 tsp honey, 1 tsp ground turmeric, and 1.5 tsp red pepper
   flake, and 3 Tbsp coconut milk.
6. Season with salt to taste. It can handle a good amount of salt due to
   all the fat in the oil & coconut milk. Don't be shy!
