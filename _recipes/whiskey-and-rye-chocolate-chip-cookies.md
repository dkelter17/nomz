Whiskey and Rye (flour) go well together. These are delectable cookies.

### Ingredients

- 1½ cups chocolate 62-72% cacao, divided
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup rye flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
- ¾ cup (1½ sticks) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature
- ¾ cup dark brown sugar
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract or vanilla paste
- 1 teaspoon bourbon
- 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
- 1 teaspoon flaky sea salt

### Instructions

Step 1

   Pulse ¾ cup chocolate wafers in a food processor until pea-sized pieces form. Whisk all-purpose flour, rye flour, baking soda, and kosher salt in a medium bowl.

Step 2

   Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add egg, vanilla, and bourbon and beat until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and slowly add dry ingredients, mixing just to blend. Fold in chopped chocolate and remaining chocolate wafers.

Step 3

   Portion dough into 16 balls (about ¼ cup each) and transfer to a rimmed sheet sheet as you go. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours or up to 1 day.

Step 4

   Position rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°. Scrape vanilla seeds into sea salt in a small bowl and mix to combine (save pod for another use).

Step 5

   Divide dough balls between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 3" apart. Flatten each ball to about ¾" thick and sprinkle with vanilla salt. Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until golden brown around the edges, 14-18 minutes (cookies will firm up as they cool). Let cool slightly on baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.

Step 6

   Do Ahead: Cookies can be made 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
