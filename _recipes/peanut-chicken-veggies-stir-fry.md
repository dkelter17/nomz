Shown with tofu – we generally make with chicken instead. We also double recipe from 3 meals to 6.

Notes:

Don't go too heavy on the peanut butter! If you go too heavy on the fats, add some extra vinegar to taste. Definitely taste everything before putting into the containers!

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C) and prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray. Then drain the tofu by placing the whole block of tofu on a plate, putting a paper towel on top, then something heavy on top to weigh it down.
2. Cook the quinoa according to the package. When it’s done, put it directly in the meal prep containers.
3. Prepare the sauce by combining all of the sauce ingredients well. Adjust ingredients to taste and set aside.
4. Heat a skillet on medium heat and add the oil. Then add garlic, pepper, broccoli, salt, and pepper. Let it cook for five mins, stirring occasionally. Add a dash of soy sauce (1 tbsp) and cover the pan. Let it cook for five more minutes. Then remove the veggies from the pan and put them in your meal prep containers.
5. Chop the tofu into cubes and toss in the peanut sauce. Add more oil to the same skillet you used for the veggies (still on medium heat). Then add the tofu to the skillet and save the rest of the sauce. (Make sure to use a slotted spoon because you don’t want extra sauce getting in the skillet, or else your tofu might come out soggy/watery).
6. Cook the tofu for a few mins on each side. Use a spatula to flip them. It’s ok if some of the tofu sticks to the pan.
7. After the tofu starts to look crispy, transfer to the baking sheet and bake for 10 mins.
8. Add the tofu to your meal prep containers and drizzle the remaining peanut sauce on top.
