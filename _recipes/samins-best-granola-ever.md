Samin Nosrat spun Nekisia Davis's granola recipe and called it [best. granola. ever.](https://ciaosamin.com/ciao/granola) It leans sweet, so this is our modification.

## Ingredients

* 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1 cup raw pumpkin seeds, hulled
* 1 cup raw walnuts, roughly broken up
* 1 cup unsweetened coconut chips
* 1 1/4 cup raw pecans, left whole or coarsely chopped
* 1/2 cup pure maple syrup (Grade B is best)
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 Tbsp packed light-brown sugar
* Coarse salt.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 300°F.
2. Place everything in a large bowl and mix until well combined. Spread granola mixture in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. 
   Transfer to oven and bake, stirring every 10-15 minutes, until granola is toasted, about 45 minutes.
3. Remove granola from oven and season with more salt to taste. Let cool completely before serving or storing in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
