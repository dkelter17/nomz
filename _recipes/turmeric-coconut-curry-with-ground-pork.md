### Ingredients

- 2 servings
- ¼ head of Napa cabbage (a lengthwise quarter), thinly sliced
- Kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon virgin coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
- 8 ounces ground pork, turkey, or chicken
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 1-inch piece ginger, peeled, grated
- ½ serrano chile, thinly sliced (leave the seeds in if you like spice and remove them if you don't)
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 5.5-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk
- Steamed rice, lime wedges, Greek yogurt, toasted coconut flakes, and cilantro leaves (for serving)

### Instructions

Step 1

   Toss cabbage with a pinch of salt in a medium bowl, then massage with your hands until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Set aside.

Step 2

   Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Add pork and cook, undisturbed, until browned, about 2 minutes. Break up pork with a spoon or spatula and continue to cook, tossing and breaking up as much as possible, until browned all over but still pink in places, about 2 minutes more. Add onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes.

Step 3

   Reduce heat to medium. Add ginger, chile, garlic, and turmeric and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if bottom of pan gets very dark, until vegetables are softened and fragrant, 4-5 minutes. Add coconut milk and ¼ cup water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Step 4

   Divide rice and reserved salted cabbage among plates. Top rice with curry and lime wedges, then dollop with yogurt. Sprinkle with coconut :flakes and cilantro.
