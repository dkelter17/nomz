### Ingredients

- 2 (red) chiles, such as cayenne, Fresno, or jalapeño
- 1 Tbsp. cookin' honey
- 3 medium Japanese or Chinese eggplants (about 12 oz. total)
- 1 lb. ground pork, ground chicken, tempeh crumbles, or crumbled tofu
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp. toasted sesame seeds
- ½ cup basil leaves, plus more for serving
- 2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
- 2 tsp. soy sauce (or tamari)

### Directions

1. Finely chop chiles and combine into a small bowl with 1 Tbsp honey and a pinch of salt.
2. Slice eggplants crosswise into 3-inch pieces, then quarter lengthwise. Heat 2 Tbsp oil in skillet, then cook eggplant until browned and crisp-tender (6-8 minutes, toss occasionally). Add more oil as necessary. Transfer to a plate.
3. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in skillet, then add all your pork. Crumble into small pieces and brown. Add garlic and sesame seeds and cook until very fragrant. Add 1/2 cup basil leaves and toss until wilted, 2-3 minutes.
4. Stir vinegar and tamari into chile mixture made in step 1. Return eggplant to skillet and add half the sauce. Combine and cook until eggplant is tender – just 1-2 minutes. Add salt as needed.
5. Plate and garnish with more sauce and some fresh basil.
