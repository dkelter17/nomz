## Ingredients

0. 1 ½ cups frozen edamame, thawed
0. 1, 15 oz can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
0. 3 Persian cucumbers, diced
0. 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced (deseed to make less spicy)
0. 2 scallions, thinly sliced
0. 1/3 cup cilantro leaves, minced
0. 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (optional)
0. 1 avocado, diced

### Ginger Shallot Vinaigrette

0. 1 small shallot, finely minced (about 3 tbsp)
0. 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
0. 1 clove garlic, grated
0. Juice and zest of 1 lemon
0. 1 tsp rice vinegar
0. 1 tsp dijon mustard
0. 1 tbsp maple syrup
0. 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
0. Kosher salt
0. For serving: Butter lettuce, cooked white rice/quinoa

## Instructions

1. To a large mixing bowl add the edamame, white beans, cucumbers, jalapeño, scallions, cilantro, and sesame seeds.
2. Place the diced shallot in a bowl with cold water and soak for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse, and pat dry then add to a jar with a generous pinch of salt, ginger, garlic, lemon zest and juice, vinegar and mustard and allow to marinate for 5 minutes. Add in the maple syrup and oil, then seal the jar and shake vigorously until the dressing has emulsified. Alternatively, feel free to whisk vigorously in a large bowl or blend in a food processor until the dressing is fully emulsified. Taste and adjust the flavors as needed.
3. Pour the dressing over the bean mix and toss to combine. Store the bean mix in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before enjoying.
4. To make into lettuce cups, lay a few leaves of butter lettuce on a plate then stir in the avocado into the bean salad. Add a spoon of rice to the center of each leaf then top with 1-2 spoons of the bean salad. Use any of the residual dressing in the container to drizzle on top before enjoying.
