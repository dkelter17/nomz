Notes:

This made a **ton** of pot pie! We tried it initially in a 10" cast iron pan and wished we had had a 12" or something a bit deeper so the ratio of filling to crust could be a little heavier on the filling side.


### Ingredients

- 1 2-3lb rotisserie chicken
- 2 medium onions
- 1 lb carrots
- 6 garlic cloves
- 1 Tbsp thyme leaves (from about 2 sprigs)
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 3 Tbsp flour
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 10 oz frozen peas
- Puff pastry, thawed

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Remove skin from rotisserie chicken and pull out the meat. Shred into a bowl.
3. Dice onions & carrots. Mince garlic. Pull thyme leaves from the sprigs. Discard the stems.
4. Melt 3 Tbsp butter in pan of your choice. Add onions once melted, stirring occasionally until soft.
5. Add carrots, garlic, thyme, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsp pepper. Stir often, until carrots begin to soften.
6. Sprinkle 3 Tbsp flour over vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, until flour begins to stick to the bottom of the pan.
7. Add 1 cup dry white wine, stirring constantly for about 1 minute.
8. Set aside 1 Tbsp of cream.
9. Add remaining (~2 cups) cream, chicken, peas, and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Add more salt & pepper to taste. Toss and cook for about 3-4 minutes.
10. Roll out puff pastry so it is approximately the size of the pan you’ll bake the mixture in. You can put the cast iron pan in the oven, or you can transfer to a casserole dish.
11. Top with puff pastry, crimping around the edges and cutting holes for the steam to escape.
12. Brush remaining cream on the puff pastry. This will help it brown.
13. Bake pot pie until crust is light golden brown, ~22-24 minutes, 400ºF.
14. Reduce temperature to 350ºF and continue to bake until filling is bubbling around the edges and crust is well-browned, ~25-35 minutes longer. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
