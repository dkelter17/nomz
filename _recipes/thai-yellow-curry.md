You can either make this in a slow cooker or you can cook the protein ahead of time and simmer it for 30-45 minutes on a stovetop range.

## Ingredients:

- 2 15oz cans coconut milk
- 2 lbs chicken thighs or breasts
- 2 tablespoons dried basil leaves
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3/4 teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons yellow curry powder
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 large red onion, chopped
- 8 cloves **garlic**, minced
- a lil ginger could be nice
- 2 jalapenos, finely chopped (keep the seeds)
- 1 cup chopped spinach
- 3 full carrots, diced
- 1 russet potato, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced

## Directions for range:

1. Cook all meat at least 75%. Brown the outsides lightly for a delicious texture in a cast iron.
2. In large pot, add coconut milk and spices. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.
3. Dice all vegetables into small bite-sized pieces. Add vegetables slowly, starting with potatoes/root vegetables, and moving later to leafy vegetables.
4. Cover and let simmer for 30-45 minutes, stirring every few minutes.

## Directions for slow-cooker:

1. Cook all meat in a skillet until about 50% cooked, browning the outsides.
2. Add all ingredients to slow-cooker, stir to combine.
3. Cook on high 4-5 hours, or on low 6-8 hours.
