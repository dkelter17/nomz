- [ ] 1 lb Gruyere cheese
- [ ] 8 oz Emmentaler cheese
- [ ] 4 tsp cornstarch
- [ ] 1 garlic clove
- [ ] 1.5 cups dry white wine, preferably Neufchatel
- [ ] 2 tsp lemon juice

- [ ] Freshly ground pepper
- [ ] Pinch of grated nutmeg

- [ ] Bread

## Instructions

1. Grate 1 lb Gruyere and 8 oz of Emmentaler cheese into a large bowl. Add
   4 tsp cornstarch and toss to combine.
2. Slice 1 garlic clove in half. Rub the inside of a heavy saucepan with
   the garlic and discard the garlic.
3. Add 1.5 cups of dry white wine to the saucepan and bring the mixture to
   a boil.
4. Reduce heat to medium and gradually stir in the cheese mixture. Stir
   until smooth.
5. Stir in 1.5 Tbsp kirsch, if desired.
6. Season with ground pepper and grated nutmeg.
7. Simmer mixture for 2-3 minutes and transfer to a fondue stand set
   over a low flame. Serve immediately, taking care to remember to
   continually stir the fondue to prevent it from separating.
