### Ingredients

- Freshly Dried Beans (3 cups dried beans)
- Salt
- Garlic (6-8 cloves, optional)
- Whole Lemon (cut in half
- Rendered fat from a meat (1 cup when melted)
- Herbs of your choosing
    - Carla does Oregano & Mint
    - He like Coriander, fennel
    - Rosemary / thyme
- Sherry vinegar or wine

### Instructions

1. Soak beans overnight in a generous amount of cool water. Cover.
2. Add "a lot of salt." Like you'd salt pasta water (go heavy).
3. Bring up to a simmer over medium/medium-high heat. Skim off foam as it heats up. Reduce to low heat to keep it at a low simmer.
4. Cut lemon in half and char on a skillet.
5. Add herbs as whole sprigs, any spices, and your rendered fat to the beans in the pot. Continue to simmer on low.
6. Add salt & pepper to taste, and supplement with olive oil.
7. Add charred lemon halves.
8. Continue to simmer, managing heat and ensuring there is enough water for the beans to simmer without breaching the surface. Salt as you go.
9. If you want to add some green, toss some in there to just wilt.
9. Finish with more fresh herbs from before, and a few glugs of sherry vinegar, or wine. Serve.

#### Toppings:

1. Garlic aioli (Carla makes her own but you could do garlic + mayo)
2. Crispy bread crumbs
