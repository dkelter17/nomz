### Ingredients

- 3 stalks lemongrass, tough outer layer and top/bottom removed
- 4 sliced jalapeños (2 for marinade, 2 for pickled veggies)
- 3 shallots
- 6-inch piece of ginger (~4 oz)
- 8 garlic cloves
- 1/4 cup black vinegar
- 1/4 cup mirin
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper
- 3 lbs boneless short ribs, cut into 1.5-2" pieces
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large watermelon radish or other crisp vegetable for pickling
- 1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
- 20 oz fresh Asian noodles (ramen or lo mein)
- Sriracha  or Sambal Oelek for garnish

### Instructions

1. Marinate: Remove hard root & top, and tough outer layers from 3 stalks of lemongrass. Slice it and add to cuisinart. Add: 2 sliced jalapeños, 3 shallots, 6-inch piece of ginger, ~ 4oz. 8 garlic cloves. Pulverize some. Add 1/4 cup black vinegar, 1/4 cup mirin, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper. Puree until it’s pretty smooth.
2. Season 3 lbs boneless short ribs, cut into 1.5-2” blocks.
3. Add marinade to short ribs, coating well. Put everything into 1 gallon ziploc bag and marinate for 24-48hrs.
4. Preheat oven to 325.
5. Heat high walled dutch oven over medium heat with 1Tbsp vegetable oil. Once hot, add short ribs, scraping excess marinade off the meat before adding to the pan. Brown ribs on all sides. Remove and place on a rimmed baking sheet once finished.
6. Scrape really dark/burnt bits from the dutch oven if present. Deglaze the pan with the remainder of the marinade to the pan, stirring often, just a minute or two.
7. Add meat back into pan (and its juices!). Add water so that 3/4 of the meat is covered by water, but 1/4 is above the water. This may vary depending on your dutch oven.
8. Cover dutch oven and place into 325º oven. Cook for 2.5-3 hours, checking around the 2 hour mark.
9. Picked vegetables: 2 jalapeños and 1 large watermelon radish. Cut/slice into mostly bit-size pieces (e.g. matchsticks or rounds). Add a generous amount of salt (2-3 Tbsp). Add 1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar and mix.
10. Shred meat in the juices. Taste for seasoning (you may need some salt because of all the water added).
11. Cook fresh noodles (20 oz fresh ramen noodles). Drain and add some veggie oil to the noodles to prevent sticking.
12. Plate, adding a little sriracha or chili garlic sauce to your liking.
