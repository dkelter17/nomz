### Ingredients

- ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 equal pieces
- 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
- ½ cup (63 g) buckwheat flour
- ½ tsp. baking powder
- ½ tsp. baking soda
- 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate (65-75% cacao) bars or wafers
- ⅔ cup (133 g; packed) light brown sugar
- ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract

### Instructions

Step 1

   Heat ½ cup (1 stick) butter in a small saucepan over the lowest heat
   possible until melted (you don't want it to sputter or brown), about 5
   minutes.

Step 2

   Meanwhile, whisk 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour, ½ cup (63 grams)
   buckwheat flour, ½ tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, and 1º tsp.
   Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl.

Step 3

   Coarsely chop 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate. Set aside a handful of
   chocolate in a small bowl.

Step 4

   Scrape butter into a large bowl and add ⅔ cup (133 grams) light brown
   sugar and ½ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until
   butter has been absorbed into the sugar and no big lumps remain, about
   30 seconds.

Step 5

   Add 1 large egg, then 2 large egg yolks, one at a time, whisking until
   fully combined after each addition. Whisk in 1 tsp. vanilla extract. At
   this point, your mixture should look much lighter in color and be
   smooth, almost creamy.

Step 6

   Add dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir
   until just incorporated and almost no dry streaks remain. Add chopped
   chocolate (but not the chocolate you reserved in the small bowl) to
   batter. Gently mix just to distribute. Cover bowl with an airtight bowl
   cover, a kitchen towel, or plastic wrap and chill 2 hours. (If you're
   crunched for time, 1 hour will do, but cookies will be best after 2.)

Step 7

   Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375º. Using a
   tablespoon measuring spoon, scoop out scant 2-Tbsp. portions of dough
   until you have 10 portions divided between 2 parchment-lined baking
   sheets (you want five per sheet--these will spread a bit!). Roll
   portions into balls and gently press a piece or 2 of reserved chocolate
   into each one. It's okay to cram the chocolate on there--some pieces
   can even be vertical. Cover and chill any remaining dough.

Step 8

   Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back
   halfway through, until edges are golden brown and centers are puffed,
   8-10 minutes. (Pull at 8 if you like your cookies softer and want to
   guarantee they're still soft the next day!)

Step 9

   Working one at a time, pull baking sheets out of the oven and tap
   lightly on the stove to deflate cookies. Sprinkle with Diamond Crystal
   kosher salt (if you're using Morton, skip it: the crystals are too
   large). Let cookies cool on baking sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to a
   wire rack and let cool completely. Let baking sheets cool (to do this
   fast, run them under cold water), then turn parchment paper over.
   Repeat process with remaining dough, dividing evenly between baking
   sheets, to make 6-8 more cookies.

Step 10

   Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Let cool; store airtight
   at room temperature.
