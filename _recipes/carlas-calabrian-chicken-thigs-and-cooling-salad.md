Go watch Carla's video and subscribe to her Substack/recipes! I transcribed this
and left out the croutons (sorry) so this is not going to be as good as what you'd
get from Carla herself.

## Ingredients

Marinade & chicken:

- 3 garlic cloves
- ¼ cup Calabrian chile paste
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 8 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs

Cooling Salad:

- ½ small red onion
- 1 fennel bulb
- 4 celery stalks

Salad dressing:

- ¼ cup buttermilk
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground pepper

## Instructions

The day before:

1. *Make the marinade:* Combine 3 grated garlic cloves, ¼ cup Calabrian
   chile paste, the zest of 1 lemon, and 3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil in a
   bowl. Mix well.
2. Season 8 chicken thighs with salt. Place the chicken in the bowl with
   the marinade and combine well. Place in the refrigerator and marinate
   overnight.

The day of:

1. *Soak your salad ingredients*: Thinly slice ½ red onion, 4 celery
   stalks, and 1 fennel bulb and place in a bowl of ice water to "de-flame"
   the onions & make them all nice and crisp.
2. *Cook the chicken*: Add a few Tbsp of olive oil to a 10-inch cast iron
   skillet over medium/medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, place
   the chicken in the skillet skin-side down. Cook well on this first side,
   achieving some browning. Put leftover marinade on the chicken in the
   skillet. Don't worry about crowding, you want the fat to render without
   burning. 15-25 minutes on the skin side, and another 4-5 minutes on the
   other side.
3. *Make the salad dressing:* Combine juice of 1 lemon, ¼ cup buttermilk,
   3 Tbsp olive oil, and an aggressive amount of salt & pepper. Don't skimp
   on the salt.
4. *Serve*: Dress the salad, serve with the finished crispy, spicy chicken
   thighs. Optionally garnish with more lemon juice.
