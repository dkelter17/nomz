## Ingredients

### Dough

- [ ] 1 envelope active dry yeast (~2¼ tsp)
- [ ] 2 Tbsp plus ½ cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for bowl
- [ ] 2 tsp kosher salt
- [ ] 4 cups all-purpose flour, divided, plus more for surface

### Toppings

- [ ] 12 ounces fresh mozzarella, grated (about 2½ cups)
- [ ] 1 cup [Fresh Tomato Pizza Sauce](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fresh-tomato-pizza-sauce)
- [ ] 2 ounces thinly sliced hot soppressata
- [ ] 2 ounces thinly sliced sweet soppressata
- [ ] ½ fennel bulb, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2–3 fresh red chiles, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 ounces Pecorino Romano, finely grated (about ½ cup)
- [ ] ¼ cup olive oil
- [ ] Coarsely chopped fennel fronds, flaky sea salt (such as Maldon), and crushed red pepper flakes (for serving; optional)

## Instructions

*Make sure to make the dough 24 hours before you want to make the pie, since it needs time to proof!*

### Dough

1. Stir together whole envelope of yeast and 1¾ cups warm water (105–110°) in the bowl of a stand mixer. Let stand until yeast starts to foam, about 10 minutes.
2. Mix in 2 Tbsp oil, then 2 tsp salt and 2 cups flour. Attach dough hook and mix until just combined. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add another 2 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing until incorporated and a "shaggy" dough forms, about 3 minutes.
3. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough is soft and elastic and starts to pull away from sides of bowl, about 5–6 minutes. It will still be somewhat sticky. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Chill 24 hours.

### Pizza

1. Coat an 18x13" rimmed baking sheet with remaining ½ cup oil. Turn out dough onto a rimmed baking sheet and let sit 10 minutes to take off the chill. Gently and gradually stretch dough until it reaches edges and all 4 corners of baking sheet. (If dough springs back or is stiff to work with, let it rest a few minutes before continuing. You may need to let it rest more than once.)
2. Cover dough on baking sheet tightly with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place (but not too warm!—about 70° is ideal for yeast to grow) until it is puffed and full of air bubbles, 30–40 minutes.
3. Place a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 525° or as high as oven will go.
4. Once dough has risen in baking sheet, top with mozzarella, dot pie with tomato sauce, and top with hot and sweet soppressata, fennel, chiles, then Pecorino; drizzle with oil. Bake until golden brown and crisp on bottom and sides, 20–30 minutes.
5. Serve topped with fennel fronds, sea salt, and red pepper flakes, if using.
