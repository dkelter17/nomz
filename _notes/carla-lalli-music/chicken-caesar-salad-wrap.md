## Ingredients

1. 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2. 2 slices crusty bread (to make croutons, if you want this in the wrap)
3. 1 lemon
4. Stuff for the caesar dressing, or make it
4. Shredded parm
5. 4 10-12in wraps (large)
6. Lettuce or radicchio or some crunchy green for the filling

## Instructions

1. Season the chicken all over with salt. Heat large cast iron pan, add some oil. Cook the chicken thighs until nicely browned. “Kill it on the first side.” Throw some garlic cloves (in the paper) into the pan as the chicken cooks.
2. Tear crusty bread into croutons sized pieces. Go small if you’re worried it’ll cut your gums/face/wrap.
3. Deglaze the pan with some water and reduce. Add a little more olive oil and add in the croutons. There should be liquid for the croutons to pick up. Add some salt and pepper to the croutons as they cook a little. Throw the whole pan in the oven at 400º until (very) crispy.
4. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and add to a medium bowl. Pour remaining chicken juice into the bowl with the chicken.
5. Add the croutons to the bowl with the chicken and add a squeeze of lemon.
6. Add 1/3 cup of caesar dressing. You can make ahead (carla has a recipe of course) or buy in a jar.
