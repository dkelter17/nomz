## Ingredients

- [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 1 onion, finely chopped
- [ ] 3 garlic cloves, minced
- [ ] 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- [ ] 1 teaspoon ginger powder
- [ ] ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- [ ] ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- [ ] Pinch of Espelette pepper
- [ ] 2 carrots, diced
- [ ] 2 celery stalks, diced
- [ ] 1 large tomato, chopped (or 1 cup tomato puree)
- [ ] 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- [ ] 2 cups of cooked chickpeas (about 2 cans (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed)
- [ ] Zest and juice of 1 lemon
- [ ] Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- [ ] ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley or cilantro

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cumin, coriander, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, and cayenne. Cook for another minute until fragrant.

2. Add the carrots and celery, sautéing for 5 more minutes to soften slightly. Stir in the tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes.

3. Pour in the broth and add the chickpeas. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover. Let cook for 25–30 minutes.

4. Use a blender to purée a small portion of the soup for a thicker texture, or mash a few chickpeas with the back of a spoon.

5. Stir in lemon zest and juice. Season with salt and pepper.

6. Finish with a generous sprinkle of fresh herbs before serving.
